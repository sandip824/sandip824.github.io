      <description>For this example project I built a ball classifier to identify balls from different sports. This could be useful for someone who is new to sports from a certain country. They could take a picture of a ball and an app could serve them some information about the history and rules of the game. This is the underlying model for building something with those capabilities.
I was able to get the model to predict the sport of the ball with 94% accuracy after minimal tuning.</description>

      <description>The intervention of AI technology and self-driving vehicles changed the transportation systems. The current self-driving vehicles demands reliable and accurate information from various functional modules. One of the major module accommodated in vehicles is object detection and classification. In this paper a speed bump detection approach is developed for slow moving electric vehicle platform. The developed system uses monocular images as input and segment the speed bump using GAN network. The results obtained by new approach shows the GAN network is capable of segmenting various types of speed bumps with good accuracy.</description>

      <title>Project 1: Lane and Vehicle Detection for Driver Assistance</title>
      <link>https://sandip824.github.io/post/project-1/</link>

      <description>This project is implemented with “Open Source Computer Vision Library”, the OpenCV. The aim was to implement real time simple lane detection and vehicle detection system with OpenCv Python. The lane detection system is a very basic yet very important system when we talk about driver assistance systems or self driving cars. Since 1990s there have been lot of work done on lane detection systems for various road conditions. like urban and rural roads, highways etc.</description>
